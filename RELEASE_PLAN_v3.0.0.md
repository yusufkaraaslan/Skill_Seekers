Title: Enterprise-Ready Cloud Storage for RAG Pipelines (Skill Seekers v3.0.0)

Hey r/LangChain! 👋

We just released Skill Seekers v3.0.0 with universal cloud storage support.

**The Problem:**
Building RAG pipelines with LangChain is great, but deploying knowledge bases across teams? Painful. Local files, manual transfers, no version control.

**The Solution:**
One command to deploy your processed docs to S3, Azure, or GCS:

```bash
skill-seekers package output/react-docs/ \
  --target langchain \
  --cloud s3 \
  --bucket team-knowledge
```

**What You Get:**
• LangChain Documents (ready to load)
• Stored in your cloud bucket
• Versioned and shareable
• CI/CD friendly

**Under the Hood:**
1. Scrapes documentation (React, Vue, Django, etc.)
2. Converts to LangChain Documents with metadata
3. Uploads to your cloud storage
4. Returns presigned URLs for team access

**Other New Features:**
• 27+ programming languages
• 1,663 tests passing
• A- (88%) code quality
• 16 platform adaptors (LangChain, LlamaIndex, Chroma, etc.)

**Try it:**
```bash
pip install skill-seekers==3.0.0
skill-seekers scrape --config react
skill-seekers package output/react/ --target langchain --cloud s3
```
