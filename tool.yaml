# Mensagens

> Send a structured list of input messages with text and/or image content, and the model will generate the next message in the conversation.

The Messages API can be used for either single queries or stateless multi-turn conversations.

                      Input messages.


                      Our models are trained to operate on alternating `user`
                      and `assistant` conversational turns. When creating a new
                      `Message`, you specify the prior conversational turns with
                      the `messages` parameter, and the model then generates the
                      next `Message` in the conversation. Consecutive `user` or
                      `assistant` turns in your request will be combined into a
                      single turn.


                      Each input message must be an object with a `role` and
                      `content`. You can specify a single `user`-role message,
                      or you can include multiple `user` and `assistant`
                      messages.


                      If the final message uses the `assistant` role, the
                      response content will continue immediately from the
                      content in that message. This can be used to constrain
                      part of the model's response.


                      Example with a single `user` message:


                      ```json

                      [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}]

                      ```


                      Example with multiple conversational turns:


                      ```json

                      [
                        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello there."},
                        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?"},
                        {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain LLMs in plain English?"},
                      ]

                      ```


                      Example with a partially-filled response from Claude:


                      ```json

                      [
                        {"role": "user", "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"},
                        {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is ("},
                      ]

                      ```


                      Each input message `content` may be either a single
                      `string` or an array of content blocks, where each block
                      has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for `content` is
                      shorthand for an array of one content block of type
                      `"text"`. The following input messages are equivalent:


                      ```json

                      {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}

                      ```


                      ```json

                      {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text":
                      "Hello, Claude"}]}

                      ```


                      See [input
                      examples](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/messages-examples).


                      Note that if you want to include a [system
                      prompt](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/system-prompts),
                      you can use the top-level `system` parameter — there is no
                      `"system"` role for input messages in the Messages API.


                      There is a limit of 100,000 messages in a single request.

                      Note that our models may stop _before_ reaching this
                      maximum. This parameter only specifies the absolute
                      maximum number of tokens to generate.


                      Different models have different maximum values for this
                      parameter.  See

                      Our models will normally stop when they have naturally
                      completed their turn, which will result in a response
                      `stop_reason` of `"end_turn"`.


                      If you want the model to stop generating when it
                      encounters custom strings of text, you can use the
                      `stop_sequences` parameter. If the model encounters one of
                      the custom sequences, the response `stop_reason` value
                      will be `"stop_sequence"` and the response `stop_sequence`
                      value will contain the matched stop sequence.

                      tools](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview\#server-tools),
                      see their individual documentation as each has its own
                      behavior (e.g., the [web search
                      tool](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-search-tool)).


                      Each tool definition includes:


                      * `name`: Name of the tool.

                      * `description`: Optional, but strongly-recommended
                      description of the tool.

                      * `input_schema`: [JSON
                      schema](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12) for the
                      tool `input` shape that the model will produce in
                      `tool_use` output content blocks.


                      For example, if you defined `tools` as:


                      ```json

                      [
                        {
                          "name": "get_stock_price",
                          "description": "Get the current stock price for a given ticker symbol.",
                          "input_schema": {
                            "type": "object",
                            "properties": {
                              "ticker": {
                                "type": "string",
                                "description": "The stock ticker symbol, e.g. AAPL for Apple Inc."
                              }
                            },
                            "required": ["ticker"]
                          }
                        }
                      ]

                      ```


                      And then asked the model "What's the S&P 500 at today?",
                      the model might produce `tool_use` content blocks in the
                      response like this:


                      ```json

                      [
                        {
                          "type": "tool_use",
                          "id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
                          "name": "get_stock_price",
                          "input": { "ticker": "^GSPC" }
                        }
                      ]

                      ```


                      You might then run your `get_stock_price` tool with
                      `{"ticker": "^GSPC"}` as an input, and return the
                      following back to the model in a subsequent `user`
                      message:


                      ```json

                      [
                        {
                          "type": "tool_result",
                          "tool_use_id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
                          "content": "259.75 USD"
                        }
                      ]

                      ```


                      Tools can be used for workflows that include running
                      client-side tools and functions, or more generally
                      whenever you want the model to produce a particular JSON
                      structure of output.

                      In nucleus sampling, we compute the cumulative
                      distribution over all the options for each subsequent
                      token in decreasing probability order and cut it off once
                      it reaches a particular probability specified by `top_p`.
                      You should either alter `temperature` or `top_p`, but not
                      both.

                      Content generated by the model.


                      This is an array of content blocks, each of which has a
                      `type` that determines its shape.


                      Example:


                      ```json

                      [{"type": "text", "text": "Hi, I'm Claude."}]

                      ```


                      If the request input `messages` ended with an `assistant`
                      turn, then the response `content` will continue directly
                      from that last turn. You can use this to constrain the
                      model's output.


                      For example, if the input `messages` were:

                      ```json

                      [
                        {"role": "user", "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"},
                        {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is ("}
                      ]

                      ```


                      Then the response `content` might be:


                      ```json

                      [{"type": "text", "text": "B)"}]

                      ```

                      This may be one the following values:

                      * `"end_turn"`: the model reached a natural stopping point

                      * `"max_tokens"`: we exceeded the requested `max_tokens`
                      or the model's maximum

                      * `"stop_sequence"`: one of your provided custom
                      `stop_sequences` was generated

                      * `"tool_use"`: the model invoked one or more tools

                      * `"pause_turn"`: we paused a long-running turn. You may
                      provide the response back as-is in a subsequent request to
                      let the model continue.

                      * `"refusal"`: when streaming classifiers intervene to
                      handle potential policy violations


                      In non-streaming mode this value is always non-null. In
                      streaming mode, it is null in the `message_start` event
                      and non-null otherwise.

                    description: >-
                      Billing and rate-limit usage.


                      Anthropic's API bills and rate-limits by token counts, as
                      tokens represent the underlying cost to our systems.


                      Under the hood, the API transforms requests into a format
                      suitable for the model. The model's output then goes
                      through a parsing stage before becoming an API response.
                      As a result, the token counts in `usage` will not match
                      one-to-one with the exact visible content of an API
                      request or response.


                      For example, `output_tokens` will be non-zero, even for an
                      empty string response from Claude.


                      Total input tokens in a request is the summation of
                      `input_tokens`, `cache_creation_input_tokens`, and
                      `cache_read_input_tokens`.
                    examples:
                      - input_tokens: 2095
                        output_tokens: 503

            The type of citation returned will depend on the type of document
            being cited. Citing a PDF results in `page_location`, plain text
            results in `char_location`, and content document results in
            `content_block_location`.

            Tool descriptions should be as detailed as possible. The more
            information that the model has about what the tool is and how to use
