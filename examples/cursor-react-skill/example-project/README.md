# Example React Project for Cursor

Minimal React + TypeScript project to test Cursor AI with `.cursorrules`.

## Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## Testing Cursor AI

Once you have `.cursorrules` in this directory, try these prompts in Cursor:

### Basic Hooks
- "Create a form component with validation"
- "Add a useEffect to fetch user data"
- "Create a custom hook for local storage"

### TypeScript
- "Add proper TypeScript types to this component"
- "Create an interface for user data"

### Performance
- "Optimize this component with useMemo"
- "Add React.memo to prevent re-renders"

### Advanced
- "Create a Context provider for theme management"
- "Implement error boundary for this component"
- "Add lazy loading for this route"

## Comparing Results

Try the same prompt with and without `.cursorrules` to see the difference!

**Without .cursorrules**: Generic React code, may use outdated patterns

**With .cursorrules**: Modern React 18+, proper TypeScript, best practices
